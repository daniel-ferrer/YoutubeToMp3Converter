# YoutubeToMp3Converter
Here's a bit of background about this script that nobody asked for:

I typically use other converters out there to download music when I hear an unreleased Drake song that I really like. 
For some reason, I never thought about making my own... and these days no games are fun to play so I spent about 45 minutes putting this together.

I'm pretty sure this will work straight out the box for anyone who wants to try, just install the required pip packages:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

Feel free to modify the ``output_dir`` variable in the driver to change where the mp3 is downloaded.
Nothing special about this script, ideally you can point this at some import folder for your music streaming service (only Apply Music to my knowledge lol).
